# React-Calculator
This is just a basic calculator in REACT.js. One of my best friends from coding school(Kingsland University) made this code and it currently doesnt work for me 
but I'm close to figuring out the problem. I'm working on trying to get it to run and get the code working correctly. More information will be added here later. Thank 
you for viewing my repository!
